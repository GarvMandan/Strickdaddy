</p>
<p style="color: white; font-size:30px; text-align: center;">Scientist Daniel Kromanhaus discovers that Phasmum, 
<br>also known as 'The Multiverse Stone', can easily be activated
<br>if at least 50 stones are bonded together using an electric
<br>current at 200V. Kromanhaus also mentions that "The world now
<br>has the ability to change itself from within, but do not let that
<br>change consume the mind of the average. This is not a path to salvation.
<br>This is a path to <strong>destruction."</strong>
